							<p>I’ve always loved space. I mean, I’m going to school for science now - not necessarily to become an astrophysicist, but I’ve had a knack for exploration and research since I can remember. I have always admired the ways that NASA engineers have developed things that help us to learn more about our galaxies, and the theories behind what could be out there. That being said, I went into watching Signs as a film about aliens and invasion. What would happen if aliens wanted to come and visit Earth? M. Night Shyamalan is a filmmaker who not only turns a sci-fi thriller into one of the most terrifying movies I’ve ever watched but makes a sci-fi movie into one about the human family more than anything. </p> 		
							
							<p>I guess that is why my father always loved Shyamalan’s films: because they weren’t scary for the sake of an audience scare; they spoke to greater universal themes. The first thing that I noticed about Signs was the use and balance of silence with sound. Quiet is usually peaceful, but here it is unsettling. My dad always loved silence in movies; whenever I’d watch with him as a kid, I felt impatient and almost anxious when a scene was too silent. I’d feel bored or felt like it was too slow. But for my father, it spoke that much louder about the things that the filmmaker wanted to show that never needed dialogue in the first place. The dialogue in this film too is a tad cheesy and only has a few well-written scenes, so I did appreciate quiet in teaching the audience more about the world of the film in a way that matches Shyamalan’s tone. </p>
							
							<p>The use of the family unit, as well, in telling a story was so vital in Signs. Graham, Meryl, Morgan, and Bo all are dealing with numerous health and psychological issues, some originating in their mother’s death and some from birth. Each character is unique in this way, and feels disconnected from each other at the beginning; we soon come to realize that they must work together in order to fight these aliens and reconnect as a family. I mean, it’s only when they all physically are connected to one another that Bo’s old baby monitor lights up and works. By having characters have such deep relationships, and only gain perspective on a global situation from their small Pennsylvania home, M Night Shyamalan makes the film grounded in the human experience, making it more honest. My dad always wanted to find honesty in a film while also feeling immersed and empathetic; for him, it was always about watching characters who felt just as human as us. I can also see how my dad loved this film because, in some ways, Graham and Bo’s relationship mirrors ours. It brought me back to being five and not understanding everything that was happening; it isn’t until later learning of the reality of my childhood and watching movies like these where you realize that your parents are just as human as you are, despite how much you admire and worship them. </p>
							
							<p>The movie is about family. Perhaps because I’m watching this knowing my dad watched the same film, I feel more drawn to make that conclusion. But my dad wrote the same response to the film in his review and his writings. Signs was not my favorite Shyamalan film thus far, but I know why it was one of Dad’s favorites. It is about the strong enough connection that family has that can overcome any obstacle or trauma.</p>
