							<p>Shyamalan’s Lady in the Water premiered last week, and I ventured with my daughter to the movie theater on Sunday afternoon to see it. If you’ve read my previous posts, you know I’ve been consistently in awe of the director/writer’s genre-defying movies and his subversions of typical cinematic structures. Lady in the Water follows Shyamalan’s historical genre experimentation, but there’s something different about it this time -- Shyamalan goes to great lengths to let us know that he’s doing it. </p> 							
							<p>The story follows a water creature (deemed a “narf”) named, quite blatantly, Story (played by Bryce Dallas Howard). She’s arrived via a communal pool at The Cove, an apartment complex where all of the other characters live. She’s in search of a “vessel” (this person must be a writer, I hope you’re understanding the symbolism). In watching my daughter react to the movie, I found that she seemed entertained but certainly confused. Now, she is only 6 years old, but I did understand her bewilderment. The film oscillates between Paul Giamatti’s forced emotional sentiments, CGI grass-dogs called Scrunts (the villains of the story), and a cast of side characters that serve the plot in surface-level ways at best. </p>
							
							<p>The film was lambasted by critics and performed terribly at the box office, especially in comparison to the auteur’s previous works. But Shyamalan isn’t stupid -- far from it. So what gives?</p>
							
							<p>I think Shyamalan is incredibly aware of the power of the metaphysical. Lady in the Water’s critics didn’t let him get away with casting himself in a writer-savior-type role alongside Giamatti and Howard, the Lady in the Water herself. They took issue with Shyamalan’s narcissistic portrayal of himself. But isn’t that exactly what he wanted? </p>
							
							<p>It’s clear that this movie is a big “eff you” to film critics and critics of art in general. Towards the end of the movie, Bob Balaban’s film critic character delivers an ultra-meta analysis of what’s going to happen next to his character -- he gets it wrong, and his demise follows. In another moment, a character says of the film critic, “What type of person would be so arrogant to presume to know the intention of another human being?” Shyamalan is on the nose, and he knows it. Most critics took issue with the film for just that reason.</p>
							
							<p>But maybe Lady in the Water is telling us that Shyamalan is so aware of his intent that he is risking failure to see the metaphysical nature of the world play out. He’s risking failure because he sees beyond the facades of success -- in effect, he’s inviting failure. Sure, the movie itself is not great. From a cinematic perspective, you might even call it bad. Many people did. But, like the movie goes to great efforts to tell us (even if it does so in a slightly self-centered way), we are all operating with distinct characterizations of ourselves and of others -- and they may not be right. Everyone may hold much more power than we think, and every person may be capable of things not within their predetermined box. </p>
							
							<p>Most people might think that Shyamalan, as a writer-director-producer, cares about following money-making hits and “good” art. That is his predetermined box. Lady in the Water looks in the face of preconceived notions. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the villains of the story lose their power when one looks them in the eyes. </p>
