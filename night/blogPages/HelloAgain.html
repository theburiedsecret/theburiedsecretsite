							<p>Hello everyone, sorry that it’s been 5 years without an update. So much has changed since then. I wish I could say this post was being written by midnight5, but it isn’t. My father, midnight5, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2012, I’m surprised we didn’t see the signs earlier. I guess we didn’t really want to see the signs, how are you supposed to accept that the man who raised you doesn’t exist anymore.  I know he had a good time making this blog for all of you.</p>
							
							<p>I never knew it existed, but after we had to put him in a home, I went through his computer in the study. He had a great time making his theories and debating them with all who choose to engage with them. I never understood his obsession with M. Night, film never seemed like an art form to me, it was only entertainment but maybe I will find something here to help me understand this part of him.</p>
							
							<p>I’m going to keep this blog up for a few years, he would’ve wanted that. I’m not sure but I might try expanding his idea and writing about Night’s new movies. I doubt I’ll be any good, but it will be a way to connect to who he used to be, and who he was trying. He would be surprised at watching his little girl deciding to care about movies, but maybe it’s a way to connect now.</p>
