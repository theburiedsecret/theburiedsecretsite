							<p>Last week, I decided to see The Last Airbender, mostly due to my daughter’s insistence. I had previously decided I would wait due to the numerous articles I have seen discussing the movie abject failure as an adaptation property and movie. However, I couldn’t say no to my little girl and her insistence on seeing Katara on the big screen.</p> 							
							<p>I think my daughter may have been more disappointed in the movie than I was. I suppose I didn’t have the build-up of the established universe going into it. I went in hoping to find something to tie it back to Shyamalan and to find what he is trying to show us. Unfortunately, I could find nothing in my viewing experience that could suggest there was something else happening. It seems that Shyamalan in his zeal of moving past thriller, and lost what has made his movies so interesting. He sought to create a great follow-up to a beloved franchise and altered the story in a way that did not suit his audience or style of picture.</p>
							
							<p>I would write more analysis but it wouldn’t help us investigate this movie. Every director has his misses, and I think this might be Shamyalan’s. Let me know what you think about the movie.</p>
