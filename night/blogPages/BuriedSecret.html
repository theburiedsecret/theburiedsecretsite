							<p>The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan, at first glance, looks to be a hokey, “inventive”, scheme in order to promote The Village. However, if we push back from this veneer, something more buried is revealed. That this documentary may have been created in falsehood but reveals so much about Night and his work.</p>
							
							<p>The Buried Secret opens as if it is an ordinary documentary. Nathaniel Kahn sharing a look into Night’s process and how The Village is being made. It evolves through the documentary to finding out why Night is so reclusive. Why does this documentary have so little access to the set and personal? Why is Night such a strange force as a filmmaker? These questions lead the documentary makers into investigating the mystic and supernatural and Night’s unique connection to it. While the documentary offers a thrilling story under the facade of truth, it is ultimately false. No matter how much, I want to believe that M. Night has a connection to the world beyond and this connection is what drives him to create. That it is what drives him to be the man that he is. The theory is so easy to pull apart, the documentary itself acknowledges this with its final scenes. The documentary closes with Night calling Kahn about how ridiculous this theory is, and even if it was true, “Who would believe him?” The documentary seeks to undo itself before the end and offers a reason why we don’t know.</p>
							
							<p>This falsehood and the sheer existence of the documentary point to much more in fact. Not, that Night has a connection to the supernatural, but that he is thinking about so much more than only movies. Night has had success after success, since the beginning of his career. He can’t do that without having something else behind him to fuel him. This success can’t be a fluke. It is too consistent to be something that happened by chance. He isn’t an insider and built much of his career by himself. He doesn’t have the advantage many before he has had. He is simply a successful auteur with a passion for the supernatural.  The documentary highlights how he is thinking differently. What kind of filmmaker would make a fake documentary to promote their film? That’s the type of decision that requires Night to convince studio executives, that producing in essence another film will help to promote the current project. Night had to have great reasoning or great power to get this made. That isn’t the type of power a filmmaker would normally have. The documentary is focused on him having supernatural power. While this might at first seem to be an ego-driven decision, it shows the effect he has on people. Night has some link to how we tell &amp; experience stories &amp; film. There is a truth behind his buried secret that I want to uncover and express to the world. What is this link, what is he able to understand that we don’t?</p>
