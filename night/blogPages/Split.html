							<p>2016 wouldn’t be 2016 without Split, Shyamalan’s latest hit psychological thriller that milked the box office while bringing in a short wave of memes about dissociative identity disorder (DID) (The memes are terrible), much to the dismay of the mental health community, but more on that later. Split tells the tale of  “Kevin Wendell Crumb”, a man suffering from DID with 23 different personalities (plus a secret 24th). Oftentimes, this story is told through the aspiring heroine: Casey Cooke, an edgy female teenager who, along with two other teenage girls, was kidnapped by Kevin. The girls make numerous attempts to grasp their situation and escape. All the while, Kevin’s personalities fight for control of Kevin’s body as a looming threat approaches: Kevin had kidnapped the girls in order to sacrifice them to a 24th personality with superhuman strengths and bad intentions: The Beast. The thriller culminates in an intense confrontation between Casey and The Beast, ending with Casey’s failure to kill The Beast, and The Beast’s escape towards the outside world.</p> 		
							
							<p>Split shows striking similarities to an earlier post in 2005 on Unbreakable. Split’s reviews are anything but (ha), being extremely well-received alongside its predecessor Unbreakable (at least by Shyamalan standards!). If Shyamalan wants to deceive the public, then why create not one, but two exceptions to this rule? Did he just happen to strike gold? Is Shyamalan just keeping up appearances with a decent film from time to time, or planning something more to what meets the eye?</p>
							
							<p>Any answers require a revisit to the critical success of Unbreakable. The Superhero film successfully subverted audience expectations by deconstructing the superhero genre, satisfying an itch of the time (that persists today) towards films that redefine existing forms. The film reeled in the commerciality of most action-packed superhero films and made conscious choices to avoid it, providing a lucrative degree of ambiguity to the film that propelled it into the cultural conversation. Split has similar origins as it engages the existing genre of the psychological thriller. Split embraces many storytelling tropes of the genre in cultivating real danger, mystery, philosophical intrigue, and the ever-so-iconic “murder of the psychiatrist”. What differentiates it are two key elements that allow the film access to a similar cultural shock value to that of Unbreakable: The exaggerated portrayal of a character with DID, and the film’s presence as a “Supervillain origin story”.</p>
							
							<p>During the film, James McAvoy must make many distinct changes between Kevin’s multiple personalities, often within the same scene. He succeeds at this difficult and unique acting challenge, earning high praise amongst many of the film’s positive reviews. Serving as the introduction to DID to most of the film’s audience, McAvoy’s acting shocks the audience and serves as the backbone of the film in cultivating an atmosphere of mystery and fear as to the true nature and capabilities of a malicious individual capable of violence through accessing DID.</p>
							
							<p>The truth of the matter is that the portrayal of Kevin’s grappling with the disorder is an egregious misrepresentation that mischaracterizes victims of DID as violent. The film’s negative impact on mental health has been pronounced by many experts whose claims, unfortunately, pale in comparison to the cultural impact that Split had through exploiting the narratives of DID victims.</p>
							
							<p>The film establishes Kevin as the supervillain in what is undoubtedly a supervillain origin story. Much of the film’s perspective, however, is offered through Casey Cooke. Casey is established as a smart, strong, and independent protagonist who has dealt with childhood abuse. We as an audience are drawn in and invested in Casey’s triumph over The Beast, leaving us shocked to witness her failure. The film foreshadows Casey’s triumph throughout its entire length through childhood flashbacks but subverts our expectations during its climax, leaving us looking to its sequel.</p>
							
							<p>Throughout both Unbreakable and Split, Shyamalan toys with our preconceived notions about the genre of these films, leading us on like ducklings before subverting our expectations. Shyamalan makes bolder and bolder storytelling choices that are sometimes controversial but always generate conversation. With the films’ sequel Glass coming up, it’s within reason to say that Shyamalan is making his own Villain Arc. Glass is looking to be the most conventional film in the trilogy as a superhero/supervillain crossover event, a common genre in current discourse. Without the anticipation built from Unbreakable and Split, however, it is likely that Glass would fall in the wayside amongst other superhero crossover films attempting to replicate the success of Marvel (look no further than DC). Unbreakable and Split, profitable projects in themselves, direct our angst towards the thrilling end to a trilogy, soon to be 19 years in the making. Glass is likely to turn a profit regardless of its execution. Even more thrilling, however, is the prospect that Shyamalan’s next twist through this film, may prove even more daring than the rest…</p>
