							<p>Every plot requires a singularity, a role to which Unbreakable fulfills with an eerie ease. As per usual, the box office has been broken open, nearly triple the film’s budget. Unusually, however, is this superhero film’s critical success. Unbreakable finds itself being a pioneer in its genre, not towards Shyamalan’s usual antics of poorly-developed attention grabbers, but towards a supposed redefining of the superhero genre. Unbreakable is showered with praise for being a deconstruction of the superhero genre. Samuel L. Jackson, playing villain “Mr. Glass” nonchalantly says “Comic books capture what people are feeling until made commercial”, a phrase stock-full with deeper meaning.</p> 							
							<p>Unbreakable is deeply aware of the commerciality of superhero narratives and subverts that commerciality through immaculately executed self-awareness. The film opens with an extremely tense scene which climaxes in the realization that a baby, the soon-to-be-villain “Mr. Glass”, was born with broken arms and legs. Is that it? The scene develops this tension adamantly, only to climax in the sentence “His arms and legs are broken” as a supervillain origin story. This film is undeniably a high-stakes thriller, but it is this ambiguity of whether or not to take Unbreakable seriously which results in such critical praise and commercial success.</p>
							
							<p>I cannot emphasize enough that this ambiguity is no passive byproduct. It is a tactic employed masterfully by Mr. Shyamalan towards commercial success. Unbreakable is dim and serious from beginning to end, but moments such as David Dunn’s (played by Bruce Willis) discovery of a superpower that is comparable to a heightened ability to (racially) profile individuals as a security guard, warp our perspective as to whether or not this is a superhero thriller deserving of our suspense of disbelief. The height of this sensation is identifiable in the only “fight” scene in a play. The fight scene could be described as raw and emotional, but at its roots, showcases a superhero holding the same chokehold on a criminal that is writhing around his living room until he falls unconscious. This is not your average superhero fight scene! This is an extended shot that subverts our expectations through an anticlimactic fight. This is a shot that disappoints our attention, thus being extremely adversary to its commerciality, which, in turn, intrigues us, and delivers on its commerciality.</p>
							
							<p>As we further enter this new millennium, we as a collective are constantly in search of new tactics, new structures, or new spins on old structures. This is a desire that Shyamalan, a genius, both cultivates, and exploits. I have been holding onto these thoughts for a while, and have been curious to see how the superhero genre will evolve. So far, no big changes and filmmakers have yet to attempt to imitate Unbreakable’s form. Did Shyamalan plan for this to be a one-hit-wonder, or will this serve as the foundation for more of his plans to come? Is there something I missed? Feel free to let me know what you think</p>
